This exploration aims to examine section C; Subjective well-being, social exclusion, religion, national and ethnic identity on the 2018 European Social Survey (ESS). It discusses the survey methodology and examines aspects including happiness, social interactions, national attachment and religion along with their correlation to European countries.  As an extension, a sample questionnaire is also included to further explore the impact of age and gender on the subjective-wellbeing.
